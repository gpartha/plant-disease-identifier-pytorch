## How to run the project
### Configurations
Update the DEVICE in `config/config.py` to either `cpu` or `xpu:0` to use integrated Arc GPU or not.
> **_NOTE_**: Instead of having two different code, use the DEVICE configuration to switch between CPU and XPU. Since we anyway need to run the code using `cpu` or `gpu(xpu:0)`

### Setup the environment

```bash
# Install uv latest version
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Initialize a new project (if not already done, creates pyproject.toml)
uv init

# Create a virtual environment (e.g., named.venv) using a specific Python version
uv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

```

### Intel libraries
Installation of Intel oneAPI and PyTorch with Intel Extension

```bash

# Installing Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit
sudo apt install intel-oneapi-base-toolkit

# Need to install using offline installer as the sudo apt is not working for some reason
wget https://registrationcenter-download.intel.com/akdlm/IRC_NAS/4a5320d1-0b48-458d-9668-fd0e4501208c/intel-oneapi-base-toolkit-2025.1.3.7_offline.sh

wget https://registrationcenter-download.intel.com/akdlm/IRC_NAS/4a5320d1-0b48-458d-9668-fd0e4501208c/intel-oneapi-base-toolkit-2024.2.1.101_offline.sh

sudo sh ./intel-oneapi-base-toolkit-2025.1.3.7_offline.sh -a --silent --cli --eula accept

sudo apt install libgomp1

# Installing Intel Extension for PyTorch 
# Dont set the environment variable for oneAPI, the packages installed using uv is enough for pytorch to work with Intel oneAPI
uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu

uv pip install intel-extension-for-pytorch oneccl_bind_pt --extra-index-url https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/us/ --index-strategy unsafe-best-match

# To get requirements.txt
uv pip freeze > requirements.txt

```

## Training the model
- Enable `cpu` or `xpu:0` in `config/config.py` to switch between CPU and XPU.

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment if not already done
source .venv/bin/activate

# Train the rice disease model
python scripts/rice_train_model.py

# Train the sugarcane disease model
python scripts/sugarcane_train_model.py
```

- Trained mode is availabe in the folder `models/` with the name `rice_model.pth` and `sugarcane_model.pth`.
- All performance information is logged in the MLFlow

### Viewing the MLFlow
```bash
# Activate the virtual environment if not already done
source .venv/bin/activate
# Start the MLFlow server
mlflow ui --port 5000
```
- Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to view the MLFlow UI.
- You can view the experiments, metrics, and artifacts logged during training.
- Look for the run metrics to compare the performance of CPU vs XPU training.
  - `epoch_time_sec` - Time taken for each epoch
  - `total_time_sec` - Total time taken for training
  - `accuracy` - Accuracy of the model on the validation set
